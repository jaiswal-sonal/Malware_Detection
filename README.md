# Malware_Detection
For detecting the Android malware, the mentioned traditional ML-based methods/algorithms we apply on the dataset:
. Random Forest Algorithm(RF)
. K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
. Support Vector Machine
. Stochastic Gradient Descent

 Steps for applying Algorithm on the dataset:
 
> Here first we have imported the pandas and then read the CSV file of the Android Malware Dataset(DEBRIN 215 dataset).
> While training and testing the dataset,the percentageof testing should be smaller than the training.
> Next,we imported the Random Forest Classifier.
> Then, predict the value of the testing set.
> Accuracy should be found using the tested and predicted value.
